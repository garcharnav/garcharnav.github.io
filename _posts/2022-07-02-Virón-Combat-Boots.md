*A work in progress*. 

Global climate change is having and will continue to have detrimental effects on our world. As regular people, it may often feel daunting to take action towards curbing climate change. A lot of the power to mitigate severe global warming seems to be done at corporate or government scales; but people can take more immediate action at smaller levels.

Sustainable consumerism is an important way to address worsening climate change. Reducing the number of things we buy and avoiding unncessary purchases reduces waste, individual contribution to carbon emissions, and tuning supply-chain feedback loop such that manufacterers produce less.

With all that being said, this post is about a pair of boots... albiet made by a company with an eco-friendly ethos. [Virón](https://viron-world.com/) is a Parisian footwear company that has developed a small lineup of shoes with a focus on sustainable supply chain and recycled and plant based materials. They've used apple and corn byproducts, as well as recycled plastics and water bottles. Also, their materials and manufacturing is entirely within the EU.
