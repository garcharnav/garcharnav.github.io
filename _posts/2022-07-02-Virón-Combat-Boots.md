*A work in progress*. 

Global climate change is having and will continue to have detrimental effects on our world. As regular people, it may often feel daunting to take action towards curbing climate change. A lot of the power to mitigate severe global warming seems to be done at corporate or government scales; but people can take more immediate action at smaller levels.

Sustainable consumerism is an important way to address worsening climate change. Reducing the number of things we buy and avoiding unncessary purchases reduces waste, individual contribution to carbon emissions, and tuning supply-chain feedback loop such that manufacterers produce less. Additionally, people can purchase from companies that follow globally recognized sustainble pacts like 1% for the planet, PETA certifications, and B Corporation certification.

With all that being said, this post is about a pair of boots... albiet made by a company with an eco-friendly ethos. [Vir√≥n](https://viron-world.com/) is a Parisian footwear company that has developed a small lineup of shoes with a focus on sustainable supply chain and recycled and plant based materials. They've used apple and corn byproducts, as well as recycled plastics and water bottles. Also, their materials and manufacturing are done entirely within the EU. The brand also hosts a sole recycling program, where customers can send worn out pairs of their boots so that the sole can be recycled. It is a neat concept, but I would like to learn more about the carbon-footprint of the process and the fine details.

I bought a pair of black "suede" second-hand 1992 combat boots. First impressions, they fit about a full size small (US 8 in my case). The sole is sturdy, while the upper is convincingly suede-like and creases easily. The inside lining looks quite like leather, but to the touch there is a noticable difference. 


My aim is to document their wear over time, and my thoughts on the durability of these boots from a relatively new and unreviewed brand.
