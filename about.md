Hi! My name is Arnav, and I am a 1<sup>st</sup> year Ph.D. student at Carnegie Mellon University in mechanical engineering. My research project will focus on creating computational models to improve diagnostics of cardiovascular diseases. Techniques that I will use during my PhD include CFD, data-driven medical diagnostics, and multiphysics simulations of biological processes.

I graduated from the University of Waterloo with a BASc, honours mechanical engineering. During my time at Waterloo, I partook in 6 co-ops and gained nearly 3 years of work experience spanning in  manufacturing, mechanical design, computer aided design, CFD, and computational modeling.

On this site you can find my prior work, resume, and personal blog. _Cheers!_
