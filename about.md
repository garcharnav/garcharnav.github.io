Hi! My name is Arnav, and I am an incoming 1<sup></sup>st year Ph.D. student at Carnegie Mellon University. My research will focus on applying computational modeling techniques to improve diagnostics of cardiovascular diseases. Through this research project, I aim to gain expertise in CFD, machine learning, computational biology, and cardiovascular biology.

I graduated from the University of Waterloo with a BASc in mechanical engineering. During my time at Waterloo, I partook in 6 co-ops and gained experience in manufacturing, mechanical design, CAD, and CFD.

On this site, you can find my prior work, resume, and personal blog. _Cheers!_
