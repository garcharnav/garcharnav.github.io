Hi! My name is Arnav, and I am a 1<sup>st</sup> year Ph.D. student at Carnegie Mellon University, in the mechanical engineering department. My research will focus on applying computational modeling techniques to improve diagnostics of cardiovascular diseases. My research focuses on computational modeling, data-driven medical diagnostics, and multiphysics simulations of biological processes.

I graduated from the University of Waterloo with a BASc in honours mechanical engineering. During my time at Waterloo, I partook in 6 co-ops and gained nearly 3 years of work experience spanning in  manufacturing, mechanical design, computer aided design, CFD, and computational modeling.

On this site you can find my prior work, resume, and personal blog. _Cheers!_
