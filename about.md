Hi! My name is Arnav, and I am a 2<sup>nd</sup> year Ph.D. candiate at Carnegie Mellon University in mechanical engineering. My research uses computational models to improve risk stratification of cardiovascular diseases. Techniques that I commonly use are computational fluid dynamics (CFD), statistical anlaysis, data-driven diagnostics, and multiphysics simulations.

I graduated from the University of Waterloo with a BASc, _honours_ mechanical engineering. During my time at Waterloo, I partook in 6 co-ops and gained nearly 3 years of work experience spanning manufacturing, mechanical design, computer aided design, CFD, and computational modeling.

On this site you can find my prior work, resume, and personal blog. _Cheers!_
