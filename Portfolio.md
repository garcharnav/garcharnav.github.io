Here is a list of projects that I have worked on in the past.

### Project 1 - Heat Transfer Fin - MATLAB Finite Differences

I developed a numerical solver to predict the temperature field and heat transfer within a fin array. To do so, I discretized the governing differential equation using the finite difference method (FDM) and used boundary conditions to form a sparse matrix of the fin geometry. I programmed the solver using MATLAB to adjusted the mesh size to study grid independence.

### Project 2 - Combustor Optimization with ANSYS CFX

To study the optimal gas inlet angle for a combustor, I developed a CFD model of a non-reacting combustor with ANSYS CFX. The model determined that a 20° clockwise angle yielded optimal mixing. Simulations were also completed with two turbulence CFD models to elucidate their effects on the results.

### Project 3 - Sensor Mounting Fin

During a co-op at Hatch, I designed a transducer mounting system to improve ultrasonic data collection on blast furnaces, featuring: 
* Two silicone diaphragms that allowed two sensors (one signal emitting, one receiving) to conform to the shape of a curved wall.
* An aluminum sheet metal frame and a 304 stainless steel cage for corrosion resistance and strength.

### Project 4 - Blood Shearing Assay

For the Material Interaction in Biological Systems (MIBS) Lab @ UWaterloo, I designed a gear train mechanism for a blood shearing assay. The objective of this design was to increase experimental output of a 24 well plate. This design used:
* 6 brushed DC gearmotors coupled to 6 separate gear trains.
* 3D printed mounting box that houses the gear trains and rests above a 24 well plate.

### Project 5 - Low Speed Drive

On the Waterloop design team, I collaborated on the design of a low speed drive. The goal was to develop a fail safe linear motion machine that provides initial acceleration to team’s vehicle. I worked on design ideation, refinement and CAD. The system featured:
* Coaxial electric drive motor with cast urethane wheel tread.
* Pneumatic cylinder and boomerang linkage to provide contact force between the wheel and track.
* Sheet metal mounts to connect the low speed drive to the vehicle’s space frame.
